<p>Perhaps it is not that simple. Have we really thought about the implications of storing and using biometric data? It may be convenient, but is it safe?</p>
<h2 id="co-to-s-dane-biometryczne">What is biometric data?</h2>
<p>Biometric identification is a system that helps recognize a person based on their unique physical characteristics. In this article, we will refer to these characteristics as "biometrics."<br /><br />There are over 20 unique identifiers, including fingerprints, facial features, and voice characteristics. We will look at these and others in more detail later in this article.</p>
<h2 id="jak-dzia-a-uwierzytelnianie-biometryczne">How does biometric authentication work?</h2>
<p>Biometric technology is used to authenticate a person's identity. It is already a feature of many personal devices, but it is also being used to provide additional security in highly restrictive areas. Governments and corporations are turning to biometric authentication to protect both physical and digital locations.<br /><br />Regardless of who is using them, all biometric security systems contain three key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sensor that captures biometric data.</li>
<li>A storage device for storing original data.</li>
<li>Software to compare the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authentication process is fairly simple; take a smartphone with a fingerprint sensor as an example. When you set up the biometric security system, you provide your fingerprint and the device stores that data for future use. Now, before gaining access to your phone, the system will compare your fingerprint with the one in its database. If they match, you can unlock your phone.<br /><br />Below is a list of the most popular biometric identifiers and how to authenticate with each one.</p>
<p><strong>Fingerprint scanners</strong>: One of the most recognized and popular types of biometrics. In most use cases, a built-in scanner examines the ridges of a finger to authenticate a person. In some devices, the camera acts as a fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p><strong>Voice Recognition: </strong>Recently, the number of smart devices in homes has exploded. Devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home are getting better at understanding commands and mimicking speech patterns. They are also learning about the people around them. These devices can even identify a caller by analyzing the unique sound waves in their voice.</p>
<p><strong>Face Recognition:</strong> In its early days, facial recognition software had to store an image of the user and compare it to a new photo each time someone tried to gain access. Today, the technology scans the user's face for unique patterns and can even recognize people who have changed their makeup or facial hair.</p>
<p><strong>Iris recognition: </strong>Although not as popular as facial recognition, iris authentication is often considered more secure. Iris recognition is becoming popular in restricted areas such as government buildings and corporate labs.</p>
<p><strong>Hand geometry:</strong> Hand geometry uses specific physical characteristics of each hand to identify its owner. These identifiers include thickness, skin tone, and distances between various points on the palm and fingers.</p>
<h2 id="mity-i-b-dne-przekonania-na-temat-danych-biometrycznych">Myths and misconceptions about biometrics</h2>
<p>Hollywood movies portray biometrics as a virtually impenetrable defense. Criminals in these fictional stories often have to resort to using a victim's severed finger or eyeball to bypass security measures.<br /><br />Of course, the reality is far less gruesome. Criminals don't have to chop off anyone's limbs to bypass biometric sensors. Still, these notions point to misconceptions that many people still have. Let's debunk a few myths that still linger around this topic:</p>
<h3 id="mit-1-dane-biometryczne-s-prywatne">Myth 1: Biometric data is private</h3>
<p>It isn't. You post selfies online, you are filmed on the street, and hundreds of documents contain your signature. Most common biometric identifiers, such as your voice, face, and fingerprints, can be taken remotely. If you use social media, all of these physical characteristics can be completely accessible to criminals through your photos and videos.<br /><br />You may own your fingerprints and voice, but you are not the only person who has access to these uniquely personal elements.</p>
<h3 id="mit-2-biometrii-nie-da-si-zhakowa-">Myth 2: Biometrics cannot be hacked</h3>
<p>It's true that the biometrics you use to open apps and unlock devices are not easy to get. In most cases, they are stored as encrypted binary code rather than image files. However, a simple rule applies here: stored data is data that can be hacked. There's no doubt that cybercriminals want your biometric data, and they have ways to get it - and those methods will become more sophisticated over time.</p>
<h3 id="mit-3-dane-biometryczne-stanowi-ulepszenie-w-stosunku-do-hase-">Myth 3: Biometrics are an improvement over passwords</h3>
<p>Biometric authentication may seem like a modern evolution of the old-fashioned password, but it's far from impossible. In 2014, hacker Jan "Starbug" Krissler proved this when he used photos to recreate the fingerprints of current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Using these 2D photos, he was able to unlock her smartphone. You know what could have prevented the hack? A password. Nevertheless, biometrics can greatly improve your security as one layer of multi-factor authentication.</p>
<h2 id="czy-nadu-ywanie-danych-biometrycznych-jest-powszechne">Is the misuse of biometrics widespread?</h2>
<p>Let's leave the hackers aside for a moment; there are many other reasons to be concerned about the widespread use of biometrics.<br /><br />First, there is corporate abuse. Private companies like Clearview AI, a facial recognition company, scour the Internet for facial images and then sell that data to high-end bidders. More than 2,200 organizations-including universities, law enforcement agencies, and supermarkets-use Clearview AI's database of 3 billion images without any accountability or oversight.<br /><br />The problem is compounded by the fact that biometric identification is not always reliable. The New York Times recently described the case of a black American man whose facial recognition system misidentified him. This technical error resulted in the man facing real jail time.<br /><br />Then there was the 2018 incident in Australia. Police there were trying to identify potential criminals after a football game, and their facial recognition technology misidentified 92% of the people profiled. "No facial recognition system is 100% accurate in all conditions," - A police spokesperson explained. Are you worried? Well, you should be worried.</p>
<h2 id="jak-chroni-swoje-dane-biometryczne">How to protect your biometric data</h2>
<p>Biometrics seem to be on the upswing, and their use will become more common in the future. However, thinking in terms of security and a little common sense can help you protect yourself from the negative effects of this technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think carefully before you decide to use biometrics. Biometric authentication will become increasingly popular, but that doesn't mean you always have to use it. Before you allow a new app to scan your fingerprint, take a moment to consider the security risks. It may be safe to use biometrics in a banking app, but a new social network may remain password protected. Approach this on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>Use biometrics for two-factor authentication, along with strong passwords. Passwords don't go anywhere. And unlike biometrics, you can change your password whenever you feel like it. Focus on creating strong, hard-to-guess passwords, and if you want to use biometrics, include them as part of two-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Contact your local authorities. Some US states, the European Union, and other regional governments are already taking steps to regulate the use of biometrics. This could be a huge part of the data security and personal privacy debate in the future, so get involved. Find out what your government representatives think about biometric security and make your own voice heard.</li>
