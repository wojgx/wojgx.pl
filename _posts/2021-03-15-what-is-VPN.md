<p>VPN literally means virtual private network. This network encrypts your traffic or activities on the Internet and makes it very difficult to identify your identity.</p>
<h2 id="kategorie-sieci-vpn">Categories of VPNs</h2>
<p>We can divide VPN into two categories:</p>
<strong>corporate</strong> - allows us to connect to the company computer at work from any place in the world. Traffic in such network can be monitored by administrator - company in which we work. Activities in such network can be limited.<br /><br /><strong>private</strong> - allows us to anonymize and protect identity, that is, change the ip address and virtual location. Traffic in such a network may also be monitored, but the better VPN, the less information it collects. When we connect to such a network we can browse any content e.g. unavailable for our country due to geo-territorial restrictions e.g. Netflix.</div>

<h2 class="entry-content">How does a VPN work?</h2>
<p class="entry-content">A VPN is an encrypted connection between two networks or between a user and a network.</p>

<h2>Why is using a VPN so important?</h2>
<p>Using a VPN is important because, first of all, thanks to it our Internet provider can see that we are connected to some server but it cannot analyze the traffic in the network or restrict it in any way. It allows us to bypass censorship and geographical restrictions, for example, when we are in a country where there is censorship such as Russia, China or Turkey, Iran.It gives us more security when using public wifi networks, but generally it is not recommended to connect even with a VPN to such a network. It allows us to download torrents and allows protection against DDoS attacks, i.e. denial of service - a massive attack on the victim.</p>

<h2>Which VPN to choose?</h2>
<p>We have many free and paid solutions available on the market, but why not use the free one?<br /><br />Free VPN in fact is free, but we pay in it with data and analysis of all network traffic, changes ip address, but all activities are monitored and logged, just like in the case of commercial solutions.<br /><br />We have such solutions that we can install on the server ourselves and those that sell a ready-made service in the form of a subscription, that is, for a monthly fee we get access to a given number of servers in different locations.<br />Self-hosted<br /><br />An option for the more advanced, because here you need to be able to install a VPN server on your VPS server.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>The solutions are two:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OpenVPN &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install">https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install</a></li>
<li>AlgoVPN &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/algo">https://github.com/trailofbits/algo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both solutions differ in encryption and protocols used, but I can definitely recommend AlgoVPN which I used for a long time. It consumes less bandwidth and has a higher level of encryption than OpenVPN.<br /><br />Cheap hosting for VPN, where VPS is $2.5</p>

<p>also cheap server hosting, but this time in Europe for 3.06 EURO</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hetzner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hetzner.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="rozwi-zanie-subskrybcyjne">Subscription solution</h3>
<h5 id="protonvpn">ProtonVPN</h5>
<p>There is one free solution that is called ProtonVPN, which in the free option allows 1 network connection in 3 locations at medium speed. Proton comes from Switzerland, and the country is known for their strict data and privacy policies.<br /><br />On the site they boast that they don't log, they protect with high AES-256 encryption with the help of OpenVPNa protocols.<br /><br />However, I personally distrust this free service, so if you want you can use it, but at your own risk.<br /><br />ProtonVPN has besides free options also paid ones, the more expensive the more servers it supports and the higher the speed.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h0YGZDB.png" alt="vv" /></figure>
<h5 id="nordvpn">NordVPN</h5>
<p>Finally, the solution I use on a daily basis is NordVPN, so far this is the best VPN I have used as a subscription.<br /><br />Nord is headquartered in Panama and has 5559 servers in 59 countries around the world. It has servers that allow you to connect to Tor, there are servers also suitable for P2P and the ability to connect to two VPN servers simultaneously.<br /><br />Unlike Proton, NordVPN has one option to choose from that offers us access to all servers. Only the time and price in the options differs, but the access is the same.</p>

<p>Nord's servers allow you to browse the Internet, watch movies, listen to music, play games.</p>
