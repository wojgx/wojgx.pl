<p>The primary function that both apps perform is to generate one-time use codes online/offline, so generating a code doesn't require an internet connection.They are available for iOS and Android, with<br />useful difference in favor of Authy, which is also available for Apple Watch and computers.<br /><br />In the solution from Google, if we want to use on other hardware then we have to scan the qr code from scratch or enter the code manually to add one-time codes. In Authy there is the possibility of creating encrypted backups, so that in a quick way on any device we can restore our codes, to do this you just need to enter the phone number in the application to which we receive the code by sms for verification, there is also an alternative method of login by confirming the login in the already existing application by confirmation.<br /><br />We can secure Authy with backup password, master password and pin.</p>
