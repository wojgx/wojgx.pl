  Strong encryption is not enough if you want to send truly anonymous emails.

<div class="entry-content">Why do you need anonymous email?<br /><br />There are many reasons why you may want to send and receive anonymous email:</div>
<div class="entry-content">
<ul>
<li>You may be a journalist writing about sensitive topics such as riots or civil war.</li>
<li>You may be an activist fighting for free speech or other human rights.</li>
<li>You may be forced to disclose information about an unethical company or government.</li>
<li>You may live in a country with an oppressive regime where your emails and everything you do online is monitored.</li>
<li>You don't want tech giants like Google reading your email and tracking your online behavior.</li>
<li>You care about privacy and security, and you don't want your emails to be traceable in the event of a data breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many email providers offer secure email services, but not all of them protect your identity. Some only encrypt the body of the email, so check to see if they hide your IP address, if they ask for personal information when you sign up, and if they offer additional security features such as burner emails.</p>
<h2 id="najlepsi-dostawcy-anonimowych-wiadomo-ci-e-mail">The best anonymous email providers</h2>
<h3 id="protonmail">ProtonMail</h3>
ProtonMail is one of the most popular secure email providers. It uses PGP encryption to encrypt your emails before they leave your device and at rest. ProtonMail also has a "zero-knowledge" policy, which means that no one, not even ProtonMail employees, can snoop on your messages. Unfortunately, ProtonMail does not encrypt your metadata, headers or subject lines.<br /><br />You also don't have to enter any personal information to create an account. You do, however, have the option of linking a return email in case you forget your password. You can also send self-destructing messages and specify their lifespan.<br /><br />A free account will give you 500MB of storage and you can send up to 150 messages per day. For more space and additional features, you can opt for a paid service. However, Protonmail may ask for your phone number to receive a text message to create or confirm your account. This may not matter to most users, but depending on the potential threat, you may not want your email provider to have a phone number that could be used to identify you.
<h3 id="tutanota">Tutanota</h3>
Tutanota is another popular choice among online security and privacy experts. They use a proprietary encryption standard to encrypt your entire inbox, including email subject lines and contact lists. Tutanota provides end-to-end encryption between users, but you can also send encrypted messages to non-users, all they will need is a pre-set password to decrypt them.<br /><br />You don't have to enter any personal information to create your account, and the free plan gives you a generous 1GB of storage. Tutanota also removes your IP address from emails, so even if someone manages to eavesdrop on your traffic, they won't be able to locate you. Tutanota's software is also open source, which means anyone can look at its code to confirm its security.
<h2 id="inne-sposoby-korzystania-z-anonimowych-kont-e-mail">Other ways to use anonymous email accounts</h2>
<h3 id="je-li-chcesz-tylko-wysy-a-e-maile">If you just want to send emails</h3>
<p>If you just want to send an anonymous email but don't want to receive a reply, consider using a one-way anonymous email platform such as AnonymouseMail, CyberAtlantis, 5ymail and W3 Anonymous Remailer. Some of these will let you use the recipient's public PGP key to encrypt the message, while others will send you a confirmation that the message was read and received, keeping your identity completely hidden.</p>
<h3 id="je-li-potrzebujesz-tylko-odbiera-e-maile">If you only need to receive e-mails</h3>
TrashMail is one of the most popular inbox-only email providers and comes highly recommended by privacy experts.<br /><br />TrashMail is a non-traceable email provider that offers free account owners up to 25 one-time emails from 16 different domains. It filters and rejects spam, so you only get the messages you want to read while keeping your real address anonymous.<br /><br />You can also set a lifetime for your TrashMail account, which can range from 1 day to a year. The account will be automatically deleted when it reaches the end of its lifetime. You can also set how many times each of your accounts will redirect emails to your original account. The free version allows for a maximum of 10 redirects.<br /><br />Trashmail also has extensions for Google Chrome and Firefox, which means you don't even have to visit the website to use the free service.
<h3 id="je-li-nie-mo-esz-po-egna-si-z-google">If you can't say goodbye to Google</h3>
<p>If you are not ready to ditch Gmail completely but still want to send anonymous emails, you can create a Gmail account with fake information. However, Google will still ask you to provide a phone number to confirm the account. Once you create a fake account, you can set up PGP encryption so that neither Google nor anyone else can eavesdrop on our emails. However, even with PGP encryption, Google and snoopers can still see your IP and your location. The good news is that a VPN can hide both, so it's best to use the NordVPN app along with PGP.</p>
<h3 id="chro-swoj-to-samo-za-pomoc-vpn">Protect your identity with a VPN</h3>
<p>A VPN hides everything you do online from ISP trackers and remote hackers by encrypting all your traffic and data as it's transmitted. It also protects your identity and hides your location by masking your IP address, so if you're looking for general privacy protection along with anonymous emails, using a VPN is a no-brainer.</p>
