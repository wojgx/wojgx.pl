<h2 id="podstawowe-funkcje-">Essential Functions.</h2>
<p>Signal seems like a typical instant messenger, but not necessarily. It has all the basic instant messaging features like sending encrypted text messages and encrypted voice and video calls to up to 8 people. It supports the ability to send stickers, emoji and gifs, and importantly it doesn't have built-in stories, but that's not the only plus of this communicator. It is also worth mentioning that there are no built-in games or ads.</p>
<h2 id="ile-to-kosztuje-i-czemu-tak-drogo">How much does it cost and why is it so expensive?</h2>
<p>Signal is a free instant messaging application available for the most popular operating systems, it is available for both computers and mobile application available in the official AppStore and Google Play stores. Supported systems? Mac, iOS/iPadOS, Android, Windows and Linux.<br /><br />What does it do for a living, then? Signal is a 100% donation-based application, so it is not funded by any corporation.</p>

<p>WhatsApp can actually be rejected in advance, because first of all it belongs to Facebook. Yes there are encrypted conversations but that's not all you need from a messenger. WhatsApp can transmit information such as payment method, purchase history, location, ip addresses, phone number, email address, contacts, diagnostic information and other metadata. If you have a Facebook account then probably Facebook has already linked your WhatsApp account to it.</p>

<p>WhatsApp has already had a slip-up, and not one (!) with leaked links to group conversations to Google, among others.</p>

<p>Telegram seems ok, but it also doesn't encrypt everything, so it doesn't guarantee full confidentiality and, to put it bluntly, sells user data to the services when they ask for it. This messenger uses its own cryptography. It is also worth mentioning that there is a Russian behind Telegram who is "in exile" and runs his London, UAE-based company.</p>

<p>The business model of this messenger is very simple, the creators prioritize privacy over making money. They don't pass on data because there is nothing to pass on, and this is what the sample attachment given to the FBI looks like</p>

<p>It doesn't have any valuable information.<br /><br />And most importantly it has open source code.<br /><br />Signal is recommended by a wide variety of people from security people to gray people. And these are a few of them</p>
