<p>Hi,<br /><br />on the Internet I identify myself under the pseudonym Wojgx, I am almost 21 years old and interested in security and privacy on the Internet. I am a member of the LGBTQ+ community. <br /><br />My publications are mainly about what I'm interested in, but also human rights activities and guides to make life a little easier for others. <br /><br />I am against 14 eyes, NSA, CIA and other agencies and a supporter of free world, free speech, free life. <br />In my free time, when I'm not reading, looking for sources, I watch TV series, I'm not a social type of person, I don't go out much. <br /><br />Hardware and software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parrot Linux / Tails / Kali Linux / macOS</li>
<li>iPhone 12 with the latest iOS system</li>
</ul>
